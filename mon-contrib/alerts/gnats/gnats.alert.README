Subject: gnats.alert v0.1
To: mon@linux.kernel.org

Attached you will find my humble contribution for the mon user
community, a gnats alert.  It may also be downloaded from
http://www.serreyn.com/software/gnats.alert/



The idea is to open a gnats ticket if there is a network problem. 

My intent is to update this as gnats 4 comes out of beta. 

Please report any problems to ted@serreyn.com.
