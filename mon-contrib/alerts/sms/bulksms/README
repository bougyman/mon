Subject: New alert for sending sms alerts through www.bulksms.co.uk

Hi.

To get around a problem we have here, I've written an alert script
which uses bulksms.co.uk to send sms messages to preconfigured mobiles
phones for alerting. It's attached, however a few caveats:

1) I'm a python geek, not a perl geek, so it's written in python. Sorry. :)
2) It requires the BulkSMS API as found on their site as well as a few
other python bits.
3) It uses FreeBSD assumptions for file locations.

Any problems, please let me know.

Thanks,
Aled.
