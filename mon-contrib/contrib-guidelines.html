<h1>mon /contrib -- guidelines</h1>
<hr>

<p>We encourage mon users to submit their own monitors, graphical
front-ends, patches, and other utilities back into the mon
community. These utilities are collected here.
</p>

<p>This page describes the procedure for getting your contributions in
the /contrib tree. We want to encourage submissions, but at the same
time, we would like to keep the quality reasonable and have everything
reasonably well-documented.
</p>

<p>If you are submitting new material to the /contrib tree, you must
include the following with each submission:
<ol>
  <li>A brief (one paragraph) description of what your
       submission does.
  </li>
  <li>A file containing your submission. If there is only one
       file (e.g. a self-documented monitor script), then send
       that. If there are multiple files in your distribution,
       these must be sent in a compressed tar (.tar.gz) archive.
  </li>
  <li>A README file, describing in more detail what your
       submission does, how to install it, who might find it
       useful,
       etc. See sample README files in the /contrib tree for examples
       of what is needed. In general, the better your README file, the
       more chance 
       other people will use your software.
   <li>A LICENSE file, containing the full copyright ownership and license
	text of your contribution.
   </li>

  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>If you are submitting a patch to another contrib'ed item, please
note the following:
<ol>
  <li>Your patch should fix a bug, or add a new piece of functionality,
       preferably by being backwards compatible. If you need or want to
       significantly change the way a monitor works, you might
       consider making a new monitor.        
  </li>
  <li>Send patches as attached context diffs, noting what is fixed and
       how.
  </li>
  <li>There is absolutely no rule that
       limits the number of monitors for a particular service, for
       example, just because there are already 5 different HTTP
       monitors doesn't mean another one isn't necessary or useful.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Send your submissions via email to <a
href="mailto:trockij@linux.kernel.org">trockij@linux.kernel.org</a>.
</p>

<p>Submissions not meeting these guidelines may not be accepted.
</p>
