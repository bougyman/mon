<hr>

<p>This page shows samples of all of the graphs that dtquery produces,
tells you what each graph depicts, and gives you some ideas to see how
each graph can be interpreted.
</p>

<p>The graphs were produced by querying a mon server which watches,
among other things, the ping and NNTP performance of @Home's news
server news1.frmt1.sfba.home.com.</p>

<p>The graphs are the following, in no particular order of importance:
<ol>
  <li><p><a href="HODgraph.html">Downtime by Hour of
       Day</a> - Also known as &quot;The Bar Code Graph&quot;, this 
       graph shows a binary representation of the state of the
       service. Red 
       means failure, white means OK. Unless your timeframe is very
       small 
       (1-2 days, or less), or you have very few failures, it may be hard to
       get 
       much out of this graph. But it is very good at showing you date
       ranges to dig deeper within (or &quot;clumps&quot; of
       failures). </p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> that this graph doesn't tell you a lot with such a
       long timeframe, although you can see distinctive clumps of
       failures around Jan 20, and seemingly trouble-free operation
       from about 17-Dec-2000 to early January. Perhaps the hardcore
       news fiends responsible for pounding @Home's news server were
       taking off for Christmas?</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="TODgraph.html">Cumulative Downtime by Time of Day</a> -
       This graph 
       answers the question 
       &quot;what time of day is this host/group/service spending the
       most
       time in the failure state?&quot;
       </p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> peaks in this graph at about noon and 2AM, and a
       trough around 7PM. The 2AM makes sense, since I can imagine
       that would be a time of low usage (and hence network
       maintenance), but the noon peak is puzzling. Perhaps they tend
       to get overloaded around noon?</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="DOWgraph.html">Cumulative Downtime by Day of Week</a> -
       This 
       graph answers the question 
       &quot;what day of the week is this host/group/service spending
       the most 
       time in the failure state?&quot;</p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> a big peak here on Thursdays, with smaller peaks on
       Wed and Fri. Perhaps @Home does most of their news server
       maintenance 
       on Thursdays?</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="FTDgraph.html">Failure Time Distribution</a> - This
       graph shows you the exact 
       distribution of your failure times, in minutes, on a
       logarithmic 
       scale. It answers the questions &quot;Are most of my failures
       short? Long? Is there a discernible pattern?&quot;</p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> most of the failures here are 5 minutes long, which
       makes sense, since we test this hostgroup every 5
       minutes. There are some
       longer failures out in the 1 hour range and beyond, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a href="SVCgraph.html">Cumulative Downtime by Service</a> - 
       This graph answers the question  
       &quot;For a given group or groups, how is my downtime
       distributed among
       various services?&quot; For example, how much time has your
       HTTP
       service 
       failed relative to the ping service?</p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> here a lot more time (about 3x) in NNTP failure than
       in ping 
       failure. Which makes sense, judging from my own experience with
       most ISP's news servers...</p>
  </li>
       
  <li><p><a href="GRPgraph.html">Cumulative Downtime by Group</a> - This
       graph answers the question 
       &quot;For a given service or services, how is my downtime
       distributed among 
       different hostgroups?&quot; For example, which are the groups with
       the most minutes spent in the failure state?</p>
       <p><b>Notice</b> that this graph is really boring, since we only
       searched on one hostgroup to create these graphs. But if you
       search on a single
       service (e.g. 'ping') across multiple hostgroups, this can
       yield interesting results.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
