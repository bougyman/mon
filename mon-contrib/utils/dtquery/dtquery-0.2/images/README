When dtquery can't draw a picture, it throws up an image called 
'failed.gif'. Cricket users will recognize this because it's the
same image :) It's included here for posterity. The 'no image
available' error should be rare, but we include it here anyway.

Set the value of the variable in dtquery to:
$main::failure_image = "/url/path/to/failed.gif"
