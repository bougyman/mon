= New in version 0.60 (from 0.55):

Started a CHANGES file.

Duh, it appears I forgot to include part of the received syslog packet for
matching. $$r{'source'} is now available.

Added "surpress_ok" attribute to checks. Now you can prevent syslog.monitor
from messaging you about the fact that the counter for the check went back
to normal.

Reconfiguration on the fly is supposed to work: Send syslog.monitor a -HUP,
and it reloads the configuration. Unfortunately, this does not work if the
-HUP is received during the select() call (where syslog.monitor spends most
of it's time) - then the select never times out and hangs. This appears to
be a Perl bug though.

The configuration file now contains actual examples of code we run. This is
expected to grow as I think of more cool stuff.
