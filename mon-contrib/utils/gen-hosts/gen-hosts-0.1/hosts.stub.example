# SAMPLE /etc/hosts.stub file
#
#
# This hosts file is automatically generated by gen-hosts, because
# this machine runs mon and it is important that all hosts information
# be in files and not rely on DNS.
#
# Do not modify this hosts file directly, your changes will be lost.
#
# Instead, modify the stub file which can be found in: 
#   $Source: /cvsroot-fuse/mon/mon-contrib/utils/gen-hosts/gen-hosts-0.1/hosts.stub.example,v $
#
# If you have questions contact the server admin at
#  root@your.domain
