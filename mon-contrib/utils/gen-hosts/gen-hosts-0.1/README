- gen-hosts 0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
gen-hosts is a perl utility program for mon that is meant to work along 
with cf-to-hosts (included in the mon distribution) in order to 
eliminate your dependency on DNS being up for mon to work properly.

The version of cf-to-hosts included in this distribution is
a more robust version of cf-to-hosts than is currently
included in mon (as of version 0.38.21), because it defaults
to using DNS (via the Net::DNS module) instead  of gethostbyname(),
which will return the first match from your host's /etc/hosts
file, if one is available, hence, it will not pick up DNS
changes for existing hostnames.

It is highly recommended that you use this version of cf-to-hosts 
along with gen-hosts.

Please see the script for more documentation and usage details.
