This directory contains 2 example cf2html-produced files, 
one from the example.cf shipped with mon, and the other 
from the example.m4 shipped with mon. 

While they are pretty sparse and don't show off all of
cf2html's features, they should provide a good indicator
of what the basic format looks like.
