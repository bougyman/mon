Subject: sqlconn.monitor
 
Hi,
 
herewith a monitor which checks on sqlnet connections.  It uses DBI but,
as it stands, is coded in an Oracle-specific way.  The matching mon.cf
lines would look something like this
 
hostgroup first_db second_db
 
watch ora_dbs
    service sqlconnect
        interval 15m
        monitor sqlconn.monitor
        period wd {Mon-Fri} hr {9am-5pm}
            alert mail.alert duncanl@demon.net
            alertevery 1h
        period wd {Sat-Sun}
            alert mail.alert duncanl@demon.net
 
There is an element of hack in that the hostgroup is actually a list of
database names, not unix hosts.
 
I am a little uncomfortable (as yet) with GPL, but as I understand it I
can sidestep the issue by making this open source under the terms of
perl.  I also understand that if it were intergrated into mon it would
them be distributed under the GPL along with mon.  Can anyone offer me
enlightenment on this issue?
 
Duncan.
