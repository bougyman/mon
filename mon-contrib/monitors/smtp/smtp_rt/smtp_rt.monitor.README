Subject: Repost of smtp_rt.monitor

My previous attempt to post this did not make it out of our MS email
system intact. Here it is again:

I modified smpt.monitor to watch an email gateway between smpt and MS
Exchange, but presumably it could watch any email gateway.
smtp_rt.monitor sends an empty message to the monitored mailbox beyand
the gateway (monitored_mailbox@yourdomain.com), which sends a return
receipt back to a mailbox on the MON host, which has a .forward file
piped to mail_handler (e.g., |/home/yourname/mail_handler) which handles
the return receipt and lets the monitor know that the round-trip was
successful.
