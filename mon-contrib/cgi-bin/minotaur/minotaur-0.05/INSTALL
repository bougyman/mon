This is the INSTALL file for Minotaur

Unpacking the software:
=======================

I suppose you've downloaded the archive in a directory called /archive
I suppose you will put the software in /public

First, verify that the archive is correct.

    gzip -tv /archive/minotaur-x.xx.tgz

If you see the word OK then go on:

    cd /public                            # where you want to put the software
    tar xzvf  /archive/minotaur-x.xx.tgz  # Extraction
    cd minotaur-x.xx                      # Move into the distribution


the bin directory:
==================

The directory bin/ contains the file minotaur.pl 
This file is the core file.


the cgi-bin directory:
======================

The directory  ./cgi-bin contains the file  minotaur.cgi This  file is
simply  a shell script calling  the  perl script minotaur.pl with some
options, the configuration file, the local lib path, and pragmas.

You just have to tell your web server minotaur.cgi is a CGI script.  I
suppose you know how  to to this. If  you  don't, read the web  server
doc.


The doc directory:
==================

I've started to write the documentation  in english and french.  I use
sgmltools with a linuxdoc dtd.  Give me feedback.

The  formats I give  is  html and ascii.  If  you want an other format
simply type:

    cd doc
    make

and read.

You need:

    ° sgmltools   for the .*
    ° gnumake     for the .*
    ° tidy        for the .htm* and .txt
    ° lynx        for the .txt
    ° TeX         for the .dvi and .ps
    ° dvips       for the .ps


The lib directory:
==================

It contains:

    ° Mon/Client.pm
    ° Translation.pm



The etc directory:
==================

The  etc/  directory  contains   messages.conf  minotaur-cgi.conf  and
infos-xx.html files. You can read and then change them.

The infos, configuration, and messages files can be where you want.


The example directory:
======================

This directory contains MON files I used to write the documentation.

The mon auth.cf file:
---------------------

Since minotaur does use authentification, you have to set your auth.cf
file to allow list,  test, and servertime  for the web users. See  the
MON authentification scheme.

You must consider that using  normal http protocol, the  user/password
data will be  seen through the network. use  https if you  want better
security.

test is a good feature but it can be dangerous.  disable and enable is
even more dangerous.

list:            test, mon, all
servertime:      test, mon, all
disable:         test, mon
enable:          test, mon
test:            test, mon

You can even enforce authentification by lines like:

list:            test, mon
servertime:      test, mon
