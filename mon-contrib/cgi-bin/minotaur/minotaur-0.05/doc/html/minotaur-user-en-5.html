<DT><B>The host column.</B><DD><P>This column contains the list of all
hosts. The disabled hosts are selected. You can select or
deselect some hosts.

<DT><B>The ``group'' column.</B><DD><P>The group column just names the group.
<P>
<DT><B>The ``Members'' column.</B><DD><P>The members column contains the
group host lists, one in each cell, one for each ``group'' column
cell.

<DT><B>The ``Service'' column.</B><DD><P>The service column just names the
services. There can be several services for each group. The
checkbox button allow you to change the state of the service. If
the service is enabled then it will be disabled, if the service is
disabled il will be enabled.
<P>
<DT><B>The ``Last at'' and ``Next in'' column.</B><DD><P>The ``Last at''
column tells you when the last test was done. The ``Next in''
column tells you the waiting time untill the next test. The
chackbox button allow you to perform a test right now. You will not
see the result immediatly because the test can take some time to
end. Reloading the page a few seconds later is often enough.
<P>
<DT><B>The ``Status'' column.</B><DD><P>The status column gives the service
status, one cell for each service. If the tests were good then
you see the string "succeeded" alone. Else, you see the string
"failed" followed by an summary information, typically the host
that failed the tests.
<P>
<DT><B>Behevior.</B><DD><P>When a service is red or blue, the group is upped
at the top of the table. The sort order is red, then blue. With
this feature, you just have to look at the top part of the
table. If you select an automatic refresh and the url 
<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/minotaur.cgi#status">minotaur.cgi#status</A>
then the view is always pertinent. You can put this url on a big
screen and get worried only if red color happens.
