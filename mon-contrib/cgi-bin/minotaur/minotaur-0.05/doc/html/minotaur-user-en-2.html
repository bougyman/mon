<h2><a name="s2">2. Principles</a></h2>

<p>Minotaur is a web client for MON, a monitoring tool written by
Jim Trocki.</p>

<p>The MON software is a general scheduler executing periodic tests
on a set of services and triggers alarms when a problem occurs.</p>

<p>The scheduler can be consulted upon a simple textual protocol on
a predefined port.</p>

<p>The web interface is based on this protocol. The CGI script
(Common Gateway Interface) consults the scheduler and presents the
results on a HTML way. By concern for efficiency, simplicity,
compatibility and stability, the java, javascript, frame and other
web avatars are not used.</p>

<p>To understand the web interface, you need to think about the
following hierarchy:</p>

<ul>
<li>The scheduler supervises groups.</li>

<li>Groups are made up with items. Generally, those items are just
internet or intranet hosts.</li>

<li>Those items can be hosts presented by their name or their IP
address, or everything else, directories for example.</li>

<li>Upon each group of items, the scheduler supervises one or more
services. Each service is tested with a software called a
monitor.</li>

<li>For each service, the scheduler can trigger one or more alarms
when something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
