    Minotaur is a web client for MON, a monitoring tool written by Jim
    Trocki.

    The MON software is a general scheduler executing periodic tests on
    a set of services and triggers alarms when a problem occurs.

    The scheduler can be consulted upon a simple textual protocol on a
    predefined port.

    The web interface is based on this protocol. The CGI script (Common
    Gateway Interface) consults the scheduler and presents the results
    on a HTML way. By concern for efficiency, simplicity, compatibility
    and stability, the java, javascript, frame and other web avatars are
    not used.

    To understand the web interface, you need to think about the
    following hierarchy:
    
    <itemize>
     <item>The scheduler supervises  groups. 
      
      <item>Groups are made up with items. Generally, those items are
      just internet or intranet hosts.
      
      <item>Those items can be hosts presented by their name or
      their IP address, or everything else, directories for example.
      
      <item>Upon each group of items, the scheduler supervises one or
      more services. Each service is tested with a software called a
      monitor.

      <item>For each service, the scheduler can trigger one or more
      alarms when something goes wrong.

    </itemize>
    
   <sect>General presentation
    <p>
    Everything is on the same page. There are five tables called
    <bf>Infos</bf>, <bf>Status</bf>, <bf>CrossView</bf>,
    <bf>Historic</bf> and <bf>Preferences</bf>.

    The page title displays the Mon server contacted, followed by the
    port, the date and time on this server.

    The top of the page shows the Mon server contacted, the date and
    time on this server.

    A <bf>link bar</bf> upon each table allows you to surf from one
    table to another or read this documentation.

    The <bf>infos</bf> table is just a place where the minotaur
    administrator may add useful information for you (links to other
    pages etc.).
    

    The <bf>status</bf> table presents the different states of
      services.

    The <bf>cross view</bf> table is used to present the status
      table in a very different way. The Minotaur administrator may have
      change this name to ``Aliases'' or ``Clients'' or anything else.
      
    The <bf>historic</bf> table is the historic of alerts.

    The <bf>preference</bf> table is always present at the bottom of the
    page. This table is used to set your preferences and login
    information.
       
    
  <sect>The preference table
   <p>

     <newline>
     <caption><newline>
      <bf><em>The preferences table</em></bf>
     </caption>
    </figure>
    

    With the <bf>refresh</bf> pop-up you select the time refresh time
    of the whole page.

    With the <bf>language</bf> pop-up you select the user interface
    language.

    With the check-boxes named <bf>Infos</bf>, <bf>Status</bf>,
    <bf>Historic</bf>, <bf>Cross View</bf>, you select the tables you
    want to see.

    You can login with the <bf>User</bf> and <bf>Password</bf>
    text-fields. It may allow you to perform special action like enabling
    and disabling host or services. 
   
  <sect>The status table
   <p>

     <eps file="../images/StatusTable-en.eps">
     <img src="../images/StatusTable-en.png">
     <newline>
     <caption><em>The status table</em></caption>
    </figure>
    
    <descrip>
      
     <tag/The host column./ This column contains the list of all
     hosts. The disabled hosts are selected. You can select or
     deselect some hosts.
     
     <tag/The ``group'' column./ The group column just names the group.

     <tag/The ``Members'' column./ The members column contains the
     group host lists, one in each cell, one for each ``group'' column
     cell.
     
     <tag/The ``Service'' column./ The service column just names the
     services. There can be several services for each group. The
     checkbox button allow you to change the state of the service. If
     the service is enabled then it will be disabled, if the service is
     disabled il will be enabled.
     
     <tag/The ``Last at'' and ``Next in'' column./ The ``Last at''
     column tells you when the last test was done. The ``Next in''
     column tells you the waiting time untill the next test. The
     chackbox button allow you to perform a test right now. You will not
     see the result immediatly because the test can take some time to
     end. Reloading the page a few seconds later is often enough.

     <tag/The ``Status'' column./ The status column gives the service
     status, one cell for each service. If the tests were good then
     you see the string "succeeded" alone. Else, you see the string
     "failed" followed by an summary information, typically the host
     that failed the tests.
      
     <tag/Behevior./ When a service is red or blue, the group is upped
     at the top of the table. The sort order is red, then blue. With
     this feature, you just have to look at the top part of the
     table. If you select an automatic refresh and the url <url
     url="../../cgi-bin/minotaur.cgi#status" name="minotaur.cgi#status">
     then the view is always pertinent. You can put this url on a big
     screen and get worried only if red color happens.

     <tag/Color legend./
      <itemize>

       <item>When everything is good the services are not colored.
	
	<item>When a service is ``down'' the service and its group
	are red.  The up-brother services (in the same group) are
	green.
     
	<item>When a service is not yet tested, at the Mon reset or
	starting, it is yellow.
     
	<item>When a service is disabled (none alarm is triggered),
	it is blue.
     
	<item>The sorting rule to present the groups is : red,
	blue, yellow, alphanumeric.

       <item>The sorting rule to present services in a group is :
	red, blue, yellow, alphanumeric.

    </figure>
    
    By default, the cross view table lists the aliases in the first
    column but does not detail each alias.

    <figure>
     <eps file="../images/CrossViewDetail-en.eps">
     <img src="../images/CrossViewDetail-en.png">
     <newline>
     <caption><em>The aliases table, with one selection</em></caption>
    </figure>
    
    To see the alias details, just select it in the <bf>List</bf>
    column and click on a <bf>submit</bf> button. You can do a multiple
    selection.

     <img src="../images/CrossViewFull-en.png">
     <newline>
     <caption><em>The full aliases table</em></caption>
    </figure>

    To see all the aliases, just select the <bf>all</bf> radio button
    and click on  a <bf>submit</bf> button.

    </figure>

    In red, the alerts. In green, the up-alerts and the start-alerts.

    You choose the number of line you want to see with the <bf>No</bf>
    column text-field. You filter the last happened events with the
    <bf>Filter</bf> pop-up. The last alerts within the interval are
    displayed with a broken blank background. You can filter with the
    date. You can filter which services or groups you wan to see. All
    those criteria are used with a ``logical and''.
