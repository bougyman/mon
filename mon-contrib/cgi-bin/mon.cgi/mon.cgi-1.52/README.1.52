mon.cgi v.1.52
21-May-2001
by Andrew Ryan <andrewr@nam-shub.com>

This interface, along with mon itself, is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/admin/mon/

Development versions of mon.cgi can be found at
http://www.nam-shub.com/files/
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the latest stable version of mon.cgi, meant to be used only
with mon 0.38-21 and above, and a version of Mon::Client that is
0.11 or higher. The chief reason that you will need the new
version is for the "test config" functionality.

This release has 4 new features of note:
1) Access control. Using the 'watch' keyword in the config file, you
   can restrict access to a particular configuration on a
   per-hostgroup basis. 'watch' keywords can be regular
   expressions. Original idea and keyword name stolen from monshow :)

2) 'watch' keywords can either be implemented "softly" -- by default
   only certain hostgroups are shown, but all can be accessed --
   or "strictly" -- only the hostgroups explicitly allowed by 'watch'
   keywords can be accessed in any way. Using strict access control,
   an organization using mon to watch systems belonging to multiple
   customers to be able to segregate those different customers' 
   monitoring completely.

3) There's now a login button. The people have spoken!

4) mon.cgi now checks for the proper version of Mon::Client before
   it starts. This was a major support problem.

Plus many other bug fixes and small improvements, as usual.


This release should be considered stable until proven otherwise :)

Please see the CHANGES file for more information about this release.

Thanks to all who report bugs, submit patches, and give feedback.
