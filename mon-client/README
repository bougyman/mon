This is the Perl5 module for interfacing with the Mon system monitoring
package. Currently only the client interface is implemented, but more
things like special logging routines and persistent monitors are being
considered.

"mon" is a tool for monitoring the availability of services.
More information can be found at http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/
and https://sourceforge.net/projects/mon/.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

and if that goes well,

make install
